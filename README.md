Here is the Back-end part developed for the portfolio project. To ensure the quality of the API some E2E tests were done, from the frontend project and using Postman.
To access the app just clone the frontend repository and follow the instructions.
Tech stack:
  - Serverless framework
  - Node.js
  - DynamoDB

Things to improve:
  - Using middlewares for error handling, security and json parsing
  - Query params for get methods to allow pagination, filters, etc
  - Implementation of unit tests
  - Option to receive an user portfolio image and save it in aws (s3)
